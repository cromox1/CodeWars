# CodeWars (Kata for my Python3/Java/C# programs)

## Codewars: Train with Programming Challenges/Kata

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as *kata*. These discrete programming exercises train a variety of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online IDE.

Codewars is where developers achieve code mastery through challenge. Train on *kata* in the dojo and reach your highest potential.

Codewars was founded by Jake Hoffner and Nathan Doctor in November 2012. The company has raised over $1 million in funding from a range of investors in the technology space, including Cornerstone OnDemand Inc., venture capital fund Venture51, Paige Craig and Brian Lee.

## Ranks

Ranks are used to indicate progression and difficulty. Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them. There are two classes of ranks, **Kyu** and **Dan**. You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1. Then you progress to Dan, where you work your way up from level 1 to level 8.

Why the names Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu (or KyÅ«) indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward. Black belts in martial arts are Dan level.

There is a score for the overall score as well as for each language that drive your overall rank and per-language rank respectively.  The table below shows the score required for you to reach each rank. You can see each rank is progressively harder to reach than the previous one.

Rank table
